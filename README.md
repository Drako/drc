Dragon Resource Compiler
========================

This is a simple Resource Compiler.
It may parse resource definition scripts of several common formats like csv, xml or json.
The output will be valid C or C++ code (depending on command line options).

Requirements
------------

For compilation:
* Boost 1.53.0
    (might also work with older versions... just adjust the CMakeLists.txt
     and tell me which version of boost you tested. Thank you :-)
